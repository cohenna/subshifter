1
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,155
Quiet on the set. And we're rolling.

2
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,885
Cody Maverick interview, take one.

3
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:36,735
Why are you guys here
to interview me?

4
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:39,025
It's what we do.
We're a reality film crew.

5
00:00:39,605 --> 00:00:41,765
Should I know some of the questions
before we start?

6
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:44,405
- No. They're easy.
- Okay.

7
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:47,135
- Can you stand on that box, please?
- Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:51,215
Right there? What is that?

9
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,385
- What is that?
- A sound thing. It's a microphone.

10
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:54,815
What's up, man? I'm Cody.

11
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,745
And you're what, 14, 15 years old?

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,955
Seventeen years of age.

13
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,115
And any other skills
besides surfing?

14
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,255
Like what?
Like singing and dancing?

15
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:04,415
Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,125
No, not me, man. I just surf.

17
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:09,785
- Loser.
- I just...

18
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:12,435
Cut it out, Glen. Stop, man.

19
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,095
We're here to make
a movie about Cody.

20
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,995
- Does he have to be here?
- It's gonna be great.

21
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:17,995
Can I get in line now to not see it?

22
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:18,545
We'll re-slate.

23
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,305
Since we're talking about surfing,
give us your thoughts about surfing.

24
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,845
Surfing. Surfing.

25
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:28,245
- Where do I start?
- How about at the beginning?

26
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,345
Okay, well...

27
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:36,115
So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer.

28
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,685
All they needed was, like,
a piece of driftwood...

29
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:45,455
...a block of ice or something like
that, and then they were off.

30
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,305
And they were hooked, man.
They were hooked.

31
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,775
Up till recent times, you had
your old dudes. Your hang-six cats.

32
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,915
These old guys used to lay down
with these huge, humongous boards.

33
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:03,385
These guys were the pioneers...

34
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:06,645
...but nobody saw
what surfing could really be...

35
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:09,455
...until Big Z did it.

36
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,715
- Could you tell us who Big Z was?
- Who was Big Z?

37
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:17,555
You're asking the right guy.
You got that far. Z is everything.

38
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,465
Big Z is surfing.
I mean, he's...

39
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,795
There may well as not have been
an ocean before Z.

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,095
They invented the ocean for him.

41
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:29,575
He lived so hard
because he wasn't afraid to live.

42
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,815
He wasn't afraid to die.

43
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:46,025
He came to Antarctica
when I was just a kid.

44
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:50,725
Man, it was the biggest thing
that ever happened here.

45
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,635
And suddenly there he was.

46
00:02:54,805 --> 00:03:00,265
Just floating over the water.
Hovering, you know, like weightless.

47
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,685
He could've walked up to anyone...

48
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,345
...and he walks right up to me.

49
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,315
And he gives me this awesome,
one-of-a-kind Big Z necklace.

50
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:19,985
And then he tells me,
"You know, kid, never give up.

51
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:23,655
Find a way,
because that's what winners do."

52
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,065
He was the greatest.

53
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,635
Everyone looked up to him,
respected him, loved him.

54
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,845
And one day, one day
I'm gonna be just like him.

55
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:53,395
And I've been surfing
ever since I can remember.

56
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,645
It's hard to imagine my life
when I wasn't surfing.

57
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:01,245
I want to get out of here,
and this is my ticket out.

58
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,595
I'm really good, man.
I'm the best on the island.

59
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:10,845
I know it sounds cocky for saying that,
but, I mean, I am, like the best.

60
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,645
I was born and raised here
in Shiverpool.

61
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,385
Lived here my whole life.

62
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:28,585
That's where they sort the fish. It's
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

63
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:33,635
But yeah, I worked there
just to pacify my mom a little bit.

64
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:36,525
Good old Shiverpool.

65
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,305
This place sucks, bro.

66
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:44,035
I worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

67
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,045
...and I ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

68
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,515
- All hard work.
- Not like some I could mention.

69
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,875
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

70
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:52,445
My house?

71
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,715
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

72
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,995
Yeah, I just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

73
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,325
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

74
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,235
He wasn't very impressive.

75
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,395
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

76
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,565
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

77
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:11,835
I mean, he's out there...

78
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,635
...in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

79
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:20,465
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

80
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,945
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

81
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:27,745
- He needs to step up and be a man.
- It takes a real man to sit on an egg.

82
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,895
- You know it.
- Quincy, come to Daddy.

83
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:33,215
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

84
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:34,755
Who's got the time in the day to...

85
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,415
Only six months in a day.

86
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,395
- Thanks for making it.
- Sorry. It was too good to miss.

87
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,035
- Thanks for making it.
- How was it out there?

88
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:42,935
He's the big brother.
I'm the little brother.

89
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:44,925
I'm not touching you.

90
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:46,595
- Not gonna touch you.
- Do you see this?

91
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,035
- Don't. Please?
- I'm not.

92
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:49,575
He makes sure that I know that.

93
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,505
I had to fight for everything.
Even Mom's tuna casserole.

94
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:01,815
I'm lucky I survived.

95
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,015
It really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

96
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,255
Like I said before...

97
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,525
...he never really knew his father.

98
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:17,595
I'm not really the person to ask about it
because I was too young to remember.

99
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:20,365
Look, I'm not the only kid
on the island...

100
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:24,065
...whose dad was, you know, eaten.

101
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:30,045
- Still, it had to be traumatic.
- No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

102
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:34,645
- What's your dream?
- To go away.

103
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,825
- To go away. That's great.
- Do you guys want a drink?

104
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:42,055
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

105
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,495
This is unique.

106
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,855
- This is not the norm.
- "I have dreams."

107
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:50,065
- When is this not happening?
- Don't make that noise.

108
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:54,235
- Cody!
- It's really disrespectful.

109
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,605
I would never do that.

110
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,405
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

111
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,245
That's the difference
between you and me.

112
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,675
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

113
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,085
Mom. Look what you did.

114
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,615
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

115
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:11,315
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

116
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:13,425
I don't understand why
everybody's so judgmental.

117
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:15,785
I understand why Mom's judgmental.

118
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:19,525
I think it's because she cares,
partially. It's also partially because...

119
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,195
...everyone else is looking at her like,
"Hey, Cody's just a bum.

120
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,765
Cody's this. Cody's that.
Cody's this."

121
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:27,995
Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.

122
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,335
When is that gonna start?

123
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:45,685
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

124
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,065
I find these kids,
I bring them here...

125
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:52,465
...and I give them a chance
to be somebody.

126
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:56,435
You know my greatest joy
as a surf promoter? Finding Z.

127
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:58,075
Watching him rise to the top.

128
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:02,475
I still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know?

129
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:06,405
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

130
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,745
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
I ain't got all day. Is it mussed?

131
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:11,615
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

132
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,485
But right now
I think we're more interested...

133
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:16,025
...in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

134
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,915
But Big Z is kind of the focus
of our...

135
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,995
Let's get the coconut filler guy
over here.

136
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:21,785
And how about the guy
sweeping the sand?

137
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:25,765
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

138
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,625
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

139
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,765
I ain't got all day.
I got a big production here.

140
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,095
Roll, okay? Just roll!

141
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:35,495
Welcome, fans, to another edition
of SPEN Sports.

142
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,305
This is Sal Masakela...

143
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,815
...and we're here at the surfing capital
of the world, Pen Gu Island...

144
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:46,285
...for a preview of the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.

145
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,345
Professional surfers
extraordinaire...

146
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,385
...Kelly and Rob tell us...

147
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,955
...what challenges
our surfers are going to face.

148
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,885
First things first, Sal. The wave.
It's the perfect combination...

149
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:02,525
...of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

150
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:05,735
Hi, Mom.

151
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:07,435
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

152
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,075
It's "The Boneyards."
Few surfers have ventured in there...

153
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,265
...and come out alive.

154
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:15,045
Are you trying to tell me
people have died here?

155
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,845
- That's right, Sal.
- A moment of silence for them.

156
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:22,075
And we keep it moving because
if the Boneyards was not enough...

157
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:26,155
...our surfers will be facing off with
Tank "The Shredder" Evans.

158
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,155
Tank, nine-time defending champ.

159
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,265
A role model? No.

160
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:35,395
But I do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

161
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,165
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

162
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:40,805
I mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

163
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,305
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

164
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:48,205
...and show them how to surf
and spend some time with the kids?

165
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,045
No, I don't want to do that.

166
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,445
- Anyway, this is my wave.
- Always classy Tank Evans.

167
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:55,345
Coming up after the break,
penguin dodge ball. Stick around.

168
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:00,125
Okay, to get back to the competition,
I just want to say:

169
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:03,225
I'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

170
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,925
But that's another story.

171
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,095
He doesn't look for them.
I find them.

172
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,995
I find these penguins.
I find the talent.

173
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:16,935
Reggie has sent me everywhere
on this trip.

174
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,665
Anyplace there's an ocean...

175
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,645
...a lake, a puddle.
It's ridiculous.

176
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:25,785
I am on so much migraine medication,
you have no idea.

177
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:29,115
The stress is killing me. I don't know
how much longer I can last.

178
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,285
I have to tell you that right now.

179
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:36,355
You gotta try
this blowhole thing, man.

180
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,795
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

181
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:42,935
I lost a bet.

182
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,665
Excuse me. Excuse me.

183
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:49,295
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

184
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:52,105
- The Cody Maverick kid does that.
- Wonderful. Thank you.

185
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,285
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

186
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,575
Excuse me, I'm looking for...
I'm looking for Cody Maverick.

187
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:01,385
- Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
- I'm Cody Maverick.

188
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:05,985
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu Island.

189
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,995
You came here on a wha...
You came to see me. Wow!

190
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:12,255
- Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
- You're here. What an honor, sir.

191
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:14,795
Lovely. Wonderful. I hear you surf.

192
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,565
- Is this true?
- You gotta see what I can do.

193
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,435
- You can actually stand on a board?
- I'll be back.

194
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,805
You're gonna see what I can do
everything's gonna be good...

195
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:23,465
...and I'm coming with you.
- I can't imagine a better day.

196
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,675
Ma! Ma, he came... the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

197
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,515
- What? Yeah.
- He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

198
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,245
You want to come watch me surf?

199
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,355
- No, that's okay.
- Just this time.

200
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:39,325
- I'm busy. I'm chopping here.
- Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

201
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,795
Cody, just be careful
of those big waves.

202
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:47,755
Well, anytime now.

203
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:52,235
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

204
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,375
I was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. It was insane.

205
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:56,875
Wow! Start the whale.

206
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,975
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

207
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,805
- All I need is one, please.
- You just had it.

208
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,915
- Dude, please don't go.
- Tough break, kid.

209
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,445
- Just wait one second.
- Better luck next year. Move it.

210
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:08,555
- Let's go. He's coming!
- Just one wave. That's all I need.

211
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:12,645
I've never won anything
my whole life.

212
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,425
Just once I want to feel like a winner.

213
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:20,995
I used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

214
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:23,435
Now that's show business.
Toucans...

215
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:24,665
Hold on!

216
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:28,435
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming to Pen Gu!

217
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:33,445
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

218
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:36,105
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

219
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,075
No, no, no, no!

220
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:48,115
Poor kid. I feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar...

221
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:49,765
No, wait! Wait!

222
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:03,405
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

223
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,215
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

224
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,245
- Yeah, so anyway...
- Wait!

225
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:34,005
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

226
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,235
- Man, we did it.
- Thank you.

227
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,905
Teamwork always pays off.

228
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:39,805
- I'm Chicken Joe, man.
- Thanks, Joe.

229
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,345
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

230
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,775
- I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

231
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:48,855
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

232
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,585
Right on, dude.

233
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,595
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

234
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,095
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

235
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,025
- Where are you from?
- Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan.

236
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,195
That's where I surf.
I was the only one...

237
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,535
...around my town who did it.

238
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:10,105
A lot of people thought
I was crazy, but I'm used to that.

239
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,475
- I know how you feel, Joe.
- You do?

240
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:15,345
- Yeah.
- Radical.

241
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:22,115
- Butt freeze!
- Somebody help the chicken.

242
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:01,985
Look out!

243
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,265
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

244
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:06,665
- Good. Thanks.
- What's up, buddy?

245
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:08,565
Okay. Later, dudes.

246
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,025
Radical.

247
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,585
Dude, look where I'm standing.
I'm standing where Z stood.

248
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:41,195
- Aw, man.
- Dude, you gotta try this.

249
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,925
- No, I'm okay.
- Come on. Just one bite.

250
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,435
All right. One bite, that's it.

251
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,535
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

252
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,975
It's not bad.
It kind of tastes like chicken...

253
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,315
Yep. What's chi-chi?

254
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:57,705
Coming through! Oh, crap.

255
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:05,495
Oh, man. I'm in love.

256
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,715
Help me! I'm drowning!

257
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:15,695
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

258
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,895
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
- She's digging on you.

259
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,165
- She called you crap.
- Joe.

260
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,275
- Thanks again.
- All right, well...

261
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,705
...this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

262
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,705
I just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

263
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,435
- I know. Bye, Lani.
- Okay.

264
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:32,105
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

265
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,915
That was just unbelievable. Really.

266
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,315
You here for the surf contest?

267
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:45,295
- Well, I'll be watching you.
- Really? You'll be watching me?

268
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,095
Well, yeah,
from the lifeguard station.

269
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:49,565
- Yeah. Right.
- It's my job.

270
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,865
- That's your job.
- Are you gonna kiss her?

271
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:54,065
- What's going on?
- Come on, Joe.

272
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,505
- You were saying you were in love...
- No, I didn't say that.

273
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:58,375
- Look, he really digs you.
- Joe, listen...

274
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,705
He likes you, though. See you.

275
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,975
I love my job.
I have an amazing job.

276
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,515
Just this week, with the contest...

277
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:09,525
...it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

278
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:12,885
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

279
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,725
But you know what? I have a perfect
record. I've never lost anybody.

280
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,955
Sure, there have been
close calls, but...

281
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,725
- Help!
- Oh, Arnold. I turn my back for one...

282
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:24,235
- Just lay some feeling on her.
- How do you mean?

283
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:27,775
- Through words. Through touch.
- Walk me through the approach.

284
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,305
- I'm Lani. You're me.
- You sure about that?

285
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:33,535
- I get real serious.
- Let's not. Let's not.

286
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:35,205
- Whoa.
- What is it?

287
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:38,345
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

288
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,915
- Remember?
- No, no. Not really.

289
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:47,195
Today, the world of surfing
lost one of its legends.

290
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,985
Big Z took his final ride
this morning...

291
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:54,655
...during a competition with
up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.

292
00:17:55,235 --> 00:18:00,175
Z was last seen paddling into
a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

293
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:13,915
Friends of Big Z gathered
to remember and celebrate his life.

294
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,275
Great shot!

295
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:18,925
What? Hey!

296
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:22,355
- Every time.
- He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

297
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,695
Stop doing... Stop it! Cut it out!

298
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:28,365
- That's like three in a row.
- Here, give it a shot.

299
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:34,935
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

300
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,545
- Don't. Stop it.
- It's a Big Z necklace.

301
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,775
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

302
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:43,075
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

303
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:45,145
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

304
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:47,305
- You don't deserve to talk about him.
- He's a big zero.

305
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:48,975
- Shut your mouth!
- Zero starts with "Z"!

306
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,985
You'll never be
as good as Big Z, Stank.

307
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,685
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

308
00:18:56,865 --> 00:19:01,195
- Keep your girlfriend out of this!
- You can't do that to my friend.

309
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,875
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

310
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:08,535
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

311
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,235
- All right. That's enough, guys.
- I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

312
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:17,975
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

313
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,485
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

314
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:24,485
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

315
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,315
Little guys rule!

316
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:33,335
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry...

317
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,265
- Cody. Cody.
- Cody Maverick.

318
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:40,265
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

319
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:55,285
Are you nervous
about going against Tank Evans?

320
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:57,885
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do I have to be nervous about?

321
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,675
Give it up! Come on, now!

322
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,675
I'm gonna chum the water
with your head.

323
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,115
- Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
- Pecker face?

324
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,715
It's mine!

325
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:41,735
So, Cody, when you take
your first wave...

326
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:44,365
...and the whole island's there
to watch, what'll it be like?

327
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,375
It's gonna be amazing.
It'll be the best wave of my life.

328
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,945
I hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

329
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:53,635
...over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!

330
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:10,095
I can't look.

331
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:14,195
- Poor kid. He's... Poor kid.
- Wow! That was spectacular!

332
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:19,965
I'm number one! The Tank!

333
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:57,865
We're trying to get the details.
The lifeguard just pulled him in.

334
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:04,835
That's what happens
when you take on the Tank, right?

335
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:07,845
Cody, Cody!

336
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,685
- How is he? Okay? What can I do?
- Yeah, he's okay.

337
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:15,855
I can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me...

338
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,685
Somebody help the chicken.

339
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:21,355
- Tank, you okay?
- Tank needs fuel.

340
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:24,065
Mikey, get the board, will you?

341
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,695
Come on. Come on. Come on.

342
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:36,175
- Did I win? I won, huh?
- You should've stayed in Antarctica.

343
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:39,245
- Oh, wow.
- You're gonna be okay.

344
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:43,615
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

345
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:48,585
What do you think about Cody going
into a contest and possibly winning?

346
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:49,785
- You know, I'm...
- Ha.

347
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:53,725
- Why did you just laugh?
- Because he keeps saying "possible."

348
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:58,335
Like it's "possible" that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

349
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:01,875
- Really, what are the chances?
- They're high. Aren't they high?

350
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:06,235
I mean, they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm, like, the underdog.

351
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:21,585
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

352
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:23,365
Geek.

353
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,685
Geek?

354
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:31,765
Geek. Wake up! I need your help.

355
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,565
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

356
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:36,405
Beautiful dream.

357
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:39,875
- Did you ever know Sheila?
- No. I don't know Sheila.

358
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,015
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- What?

359
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,175
Who's this guy?

360
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:46,075
- He's a surfer. He's hurt.
- Who are all those guys?

361
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,375
They're with him. Ignore them.

362
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,285
- Come on.
- Lani, what are you doing?

363
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:52,615
If you help him, they'll go away.

364
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,315
- Hey! Get out of here!
- Help him!

365
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,825
- Where do you want him?
- Nowhere. That's the whole point.

366
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:02,025
- No outsiders. Come on.
- I know, I know, I know.

367
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:06,535
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. I don't know if he...

368
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,705
- And did he hit the reef?
- I don't know.

369
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,365
I'm not sure. I got him after...

370
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:15,345
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. No.

371
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:19,075
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

372
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:23,415
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

373
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,555
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken...

374
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:33,565
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

375
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:36,435
- What... Cody!
- I hurt.

376
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:40,005
- You're gonna be okay. What?
- Maybe I shouldn't have taken that out.

377
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,075
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

378
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:44,675
- What's amazing?
- That you're still alive.

379
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:49,045
It's all right. I'm gonna fix you up.
I can fix your foot just fine.

380
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:52,975
- Where is it? I've been looking...
- It's a saw. You just threw a saw.

381
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:57,915
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

382
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,325
- Come on, come on.
- I know he looks...

383
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,425
Here it is.

384
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,485
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

385
00:25:05,665 --> 00:25:06,965
This is a sure-fire cure.

386
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:11,095
I learned it from an old medicine
man. It, well, works wonders.

387
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:13,365
- What? No! Not that!
- Not what?

388
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,765
What is he gonna... Gonna what?

389
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:17,875
- Come on, now.
- Geek, stop.

390
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:21,485
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

391
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,945
- Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
- What is water sounds?

392
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:27,845
- Come on. Here we go.
- No, no, no. You...

393
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,885
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd I tell you?

394
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,125
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

395
00:25:38,295 --> 00:25:40,455
- I'm running on empty here.
- I'm trying!

396
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,205
So how you been?

397
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:51,715
Wow, sea urchin in the foot.
That sounds pretty nasty.

398
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,865
Yeah.

399
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,745
How do you cure something like that?

400
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,315
You pee on it.

401
00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:00,585
- That's disgusting.
- I know!

402
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:04,155
Hey. How long am I stuck
with this guy?

403
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:06,185
- Because you know...
- Till he's better.

404
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:10,955
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

405
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:12,655
- No.
- I'm running low here.

406
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:15,495
I can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

407
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,325
- Oh, come on.
- Bye.

408
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:22,295
- Bring me some more clams!
- Okay.

409
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:34,885
If it's just as well with you,
I don't want to talk about Cody.

410
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:37,145
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. It's not mine.

411
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:39,185
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being...?

412
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:42,125
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

413
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:45,055
- Did you see that wave hit him?
- That's the whole idea of surfing.

414
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:48,355
- I care. I care!
- Mikey! Wait till you see this.

415
00:26:49,305 --> 00:26:51,365
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

416
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:54,005
It's the way I walk. I'm constantly...

417
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:57,145
- Boom-chicka-chicka...
- What's with the "boom-chicka-boom"?

418
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:01,575
I can't stand blood.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

419
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,585
I can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

420
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:11,315
- Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
- No.

421
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:14,695
Cody? Cody?

422
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,455
He's not under there.

423
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:21,765
Cody!

424
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:24,935
How's it going, man?

425
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:29,945
So I woke up this morning.

426
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:34,515
I didn't know where I was. It's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

427
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,875
Come on. Get up.

428
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:38,745
- I don't want to.
- Breakfast.

429
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:42,355
- Wakey, wakey. Come on.
- I don't want to.

430
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:44,985
- How's your foot?
- My foot...

431
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:49,255
- My foot's fine, but my head.
- Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

432
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:51,725
What the...?

433
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,255
Yeah, I think I got a concussion.

434
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:02,035
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

435
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:07,705
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? It's gotta...

436
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,875
No, no.

437
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:13,175
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

438
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:16,585
It's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

439
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:20,025
- Who?
- Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

440
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,625
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

441
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,765
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

442
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,395
...because that's what winners do.
- What winners do. Yeah.

443
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:30,125
It's funny, you know,
what a loser I became.

444
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:34,605
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

445
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:40,405
...you know, do things your own way.
- I don't have a way.

446
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:47,915
You do now. Just follow this.
It'll take you back to North Beach.

447
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:51,285
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

448
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:01,255
What do I do now?

449
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,925
I can't show my face on the beach.
I can't go home.

450
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:11,365
You always visualize where you're
gonna be, what you're gonna do.

451
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:16,875
This ain't it.

452
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:48,415
- What are you doing here?
- Here.

453
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:52,485
- Oh, man. Thank you, man. This...
- Yeah.

454
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,245
That's cool of you to come back.

455
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,445
- Thank you.
- Better keep that knot tight.

456
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,785
You lose it during a contest,
it's a goner.

457
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:02,555
Yeah, well, I'm not going
in any surf contests.

458
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:08,655
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

459
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,365
Yeah.

460
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,475
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

461
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:16,935
That's koa wood.

462
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,235
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

463
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:22,435
- Yeah?
- You got a koa board?

464
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:28,385
- No, I don't have a "board" board.
- Well, you wanna...?

465
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,645
You want to make one?

466
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:33,315
- Nah.
- What?

467
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:35,795
I come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

468
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:39,455
...and I'm offering to make you
a board and you say, "Nah."

469
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:42,365
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

470
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:44,405
- All right.
- It's gonna be the best board...

471
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:45,595
...you ever had.

472
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:47,325
- All right?
- Okay, man.

473
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:48,565
Cody!

474
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,365
That's cool.

475
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:55,575
Joe, can you just tell us
why you're out here looking for Cody?

476
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:58,115
You know, we've known
each other way back...

477
00:30:58,285 --> 00:31:03,155
...since, like, yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common.

478
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,485
I never really knew my father either.

479
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,785
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

480
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:17,455
I'm just trying to understand.
I don't get it.

481
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:21,165
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

482
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:26,375
Okay, it's just...
Are you a surfer, or do you...?

483
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,005
- Very funny.
- Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

484
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,985
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

485
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:36,945
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

486
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:40,855
I didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

487
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,055
It's not like I intentionally did it.
I'm sorry.

488
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:48,325
- Cody. The log!
- Yeah, I know!

489
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:52,565
Geek! Stop, stop!

490
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:57,775
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

491
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:01,645
- Now, pull it.
- I'm trying!

492
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:03,615
Pull!

493
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:09,615
Cody!

494
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,225
Geek!

495
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:14,185
Cody!

496
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:23,505
Oh, no, no, no.

497
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:28,705
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

498
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:34,445
- I thought I killed you. You okay?
- Next time, when I say don't roll the...

499
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:36,745
Wait. What's that?

500
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:43,415
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

501
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:46,255
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

502
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,685
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

503
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,995
You think Cody and the Geek
are doing all right?

504
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,895
Yeah. I hate to see him
living out there all alone.

505
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:00,935
It'll be good for him
to have something to do.

506
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:16,525
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

507
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:25,395
Look at this.

508
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:31,205
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

509
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:34,305
These are Big Z's boards.

510
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:38,635
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

511
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:43,015
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

512
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:45,945
This... I... Geek!

513
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,715
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

514
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:50,585
This is where he made his boards!

515
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:52,125
Did you know this was here?

516
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,385
Why didn't you wanna
come down here?

517
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:58,655
And then he went up to this
old shack, you know.

518
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:16,075
And I realized, you know...

519
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,985
...it was Z.

520
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,735
I could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

521
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:47,915
I didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

522
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,845
So I just kind of stood there quietly.

523
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:53,485
You're Big Z! I can't believe it.

524
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:55,415
You're alive! You're alive!

525
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,385
That's the respectful way to go,
I think.

526
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,985
Why are you alive?
What happened?

527
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,425
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

528
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:04,355
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

529
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,295
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

530
00:35:08,635 --> 00:35:10,265
Did something happen?
Something happened.

531
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,735
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

532
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,135
I knew it!
That's what happened!

533
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:17,135
Are you nuts?
It's not a conspiracy. It's no big deal.

534
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:20,935
- What happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

535
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:25,175
You don't... Okay, I got it!

536
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:29,985
I'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

537
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:32,725
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

538
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:35,625
- Go away.
- Got it. All right. I'm going away.

539
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,025
Unless you...

540
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:38,695
- Cody!
- Okay, got it.

541
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:42,165
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

542
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:45,705
It changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

543
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:50,965
If I can get him to train me, then...
Boom. I could win this with him.

544
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:54,905
It's my dream. And I don't want to
give up on that dream.

545
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:58,015
Winners find a way,
no matter what, right?

546
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:02,075
A winner is...

547
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,545
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

548
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:08,815
They're not in it
for the money or glory.

549
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:12,325
- A winner is... like...
- Hey, hey!

550
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:15,365
It's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

551
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:16,865
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

552
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,395
Right, I get you. What's winning
without the losers?

553
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:23,045
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

554
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,195
...and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my...

555
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,215
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

556
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,145
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

557
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:32,805
Was that your question?

558
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:37,315
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

559
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,525
...and break it when I'm trying
to get some big waves.

560
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:43,495
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

561
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:46,495
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

562
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:49,655
Yeah, I can't remember a time
when I wasn't surfing.

563
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,765
My mom put me right on there.
I think she pooped me out...

564
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:54,235
...just put me right on there.

565
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,105
What is it about surfing
that you love?

566
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,535
I love being the center of attention...

567
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:01,445
...because it's really
where I should be.

568
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:06,215
And I love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

569
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:10,415
The little glint. I love that.
I love holding the ladies.

570
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,615
- You know what I'm talking about?
- I think so.

571
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:16,195
- Sort of.
- Come with me.

572
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:21,265
Put this curtain in myself.

573
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,235
These are my ladies.

574
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,035
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

575
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,545
Little Suzie. Briana.

576
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:34,645
- You know why we call her Briana?
- No.

577
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,245
It's a long story.

578
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,215
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

579
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:41,545
Jeannie. I dream of...

580
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:45,585
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

581
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:49,595
- Now, is Theresa, is that your...
- Dirty girl.

582
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:55,095
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

583
00:37:55,935 --> 00:38:00,165
I'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

584
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,395
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

585
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:05,275
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

586
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:11,075
Mom, I wasn't polishing.
I was talking to my friends.

587
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:14,445
I'm gonna be polishing later.

588
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:18,115
When's he coming out?
I'm running out of film.

589
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:21,585
Mr. Topanga! Could you
tell us why you're not dead?

590
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:25,055
No! I am dead! I'm dead.

591
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:32,465
What are you doing?

592
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:35,875
Hey, who said you...

593
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:38,705
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

594
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:40,935
Come out here
and show me some moves.

595
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:42,475
- No, no.
- Come on!

596
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:46,315
- Grab a board and come out.
- You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

597
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:48,785
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

598
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:52,725
- How do you turn this thing?
- It's not a short board. Sit back on it.

599
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,385
Hey, watch the wave!

600
00:38:56,725 --> 00:39:00,025
You mess up my board,
I'm messing up your other foot.

601
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:04,435
I'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

602
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:08,135
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

603
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,665
What do you mean, rela...?

604
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:15,475
Long, smooth strokes.

605
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,615
- Dig deep. Dig, come on.
- I'm digging!

606
00:39:18,785 --> 00:39:22,315
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

607
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:31,855
- What are you doing?
- Come on, please?

608
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,495
Z, I can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

609
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,535
Well, then you're not gonna
learn anything.

610
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:40,865
- Now, come on in.
- I'm not coming in until you come out.

611
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:44,835
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

612
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:47,305
- What wave?
- That one.

613
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:51,775
Five, four, three, two, and...

614
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:06,825
- Don't touch my stuff, man.
- I couldn't help it.

615
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:11,165
- I just wanted to learn from the best.
- Yeah, well.

616
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:13,935
- I don't surf anymore, okay?
- What?

617
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:15,735
What do you mean, you don't surf?

618
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:18,235
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

619
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,845
Sure.

620
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,845
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

621
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:26,675
- What do you mean, you don't sur...
- Can't hear you.

622
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:28,685
- Can I ask one question...
- We're making a board.

623
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:31,345
Could you tell me
about your board?

624
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:35,155
I just have a palm tree board.

625
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:38,425
I would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

626
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,535
...but it is a pretty good board.

627
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:43,495
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that "mana" or heart...

628
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:46,465
...was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

629
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:48,765
What are your thoughts on that?

630
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:52,235
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

631
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:54,935
My dream surfboard.
It's pretty powerful.

632
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:58,445
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

633
00:40:58,615 --> 00:40:59,915
Anybody know whose board this is?

634
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,955
- I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
- Has anybody seen the chicken?

635
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,185
Cody!

636
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:09,225
I know he's out here.
I can feel it in my nuggets.

637
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:12,835
Aren't you nervous out here
in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.

638
00:41:12,995 --> 00:41:16,595
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

639
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:25,675
- Hold it steady.
- This is a dream come true.

640
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:28,975
This is a dream come true,
to be here with Z, doing this.

641
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,135
- And it's koa wood.
- Where's the...

642
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:33,285
All the best boards
are made from koa wood.

643
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:38,485
All right, now,
I drew this pattern as a guide.

644
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:43,395
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

645
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,465
I don't know.

646
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:48,655
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

647
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,425
- I'm the expert here.
- Okay.

648
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,295
So...

649
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,795
...here are your shaping tools.

650
00:41:55,245 --> 00:42:00,045
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

651
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:03,545
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

652
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:06,375
- Reveal it. All right?
- Okay.

653
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:10,255
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

654
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:14,415
- I'm not smiling. I'm excited.
- This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

655
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:16,995
It takes patience and finesse.

656
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:20,425
All right already. Can you just
give me the tools, please?

657
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:23,155
- Here, take it. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

658
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:27,095
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

659
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,495
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

660
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:33,835
All right, look.
First of all, with the grain.

661
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:37,105
With the grain.
You see what I'm doing here?

662
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:41,115
You let the tool do the work.
You see?

663
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:44,115
Just like you're riding a wave.
You let the wave do the work.

664
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:48,485
You don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves.

665
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:52,925
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

666
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:57,025
Find the board within the tree.

667
00:42:57,205 --> 00:43:00,295
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah, I got it.

668
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:02,635
See that? You just...

669
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:05,135
- You just...
- Maybe I could do it now.

670
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,905
Move with...

671
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:10,475
- With the...
- Can I do it now?

672
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:13,845
Can I do it now?

673
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:20,415
Yeah. I got carried away.
Sorry about that.

674
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:22,615
- It's your board.
- My board.

675
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:25,085
Okay, with the grain. I got it.

676
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:27,495
Don't forget to eyeball it
once in a while.

677
00:43:27,665 --> 00:43:31,325
- Long strokes, with the grain.
- Not too long.

678
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:33,305
Here we go.

679
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:39,675
- You're doing it wrong.
- Will you just let me...

680
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:43,075
I can't... No finesse
when you're in my face. Okay?

681
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,185
Just let me make the board.

682
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:48,085
- Do you want my help?
- No, I don't want your help.

683
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:49,585
I don't want your help.

684
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,725
- You don't want my help?
- I don't want your help.

685
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,955
- All right. Fine.
- I want to make my board.

686
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:58,685
- Build the board yourself, all right?
- Thank you.

687
00:43:58,865 --> 00:44:02,165
I don't care what the board
looks like. You're the one...

688
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,305
...who's got to ride the thing.
- Fine. Thank you.

689
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:10,675
- It's in there somewhere.
- Walk over there, please! Please.

690
00:44:11,145 --> 00:44:13,405
Don't cut yourself.

691
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:16,275
So it's day three, yeah?

692
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:20,705
I come across Pen Guans.

693
00:44:20,885 --> 00:44:24,325
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph.
It's long for Joe.

694
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,055
Sweet, man.

695
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:30,495
And they treat me as their king
and put me in a hot tub.

696
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:33,695
It is, I guess, their royal hot tub.

697
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,375
It got kind of hot and steamy.

698
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:54,105
But really opened up
my pores, you know?

699
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:57,615
It was kind of cool.

700
00:44:57,785 --> 00:45:00,485
They served me food
while I was in there.

701
00:45:00,695 --> 00:45:03,355
It was like dinner and a show.

702
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,535
As enjoyable as it was,
I still had a vision of my quest.

703
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:23,515
Thank you. See you guys later.
I gotta get going.

704
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,875
Not again.

705
00:45:29,055 --> 00:45:31,115
You know what else it was?
I had the board.

706
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:32,985
The board was fine.
The board was great.

707
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:39,385
- How's it going?
- It's going great, man. It's great.

708
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,355
It did look a little rough.

709
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:44,935
A little rough? The board looked
a little... It's a work in progress, bro.

710
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:47,005
You think it's good enough
for the big waves?

711
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:50,575
I think it's good enough
for any wave.

712
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:53,535
Hang on.

713
00:45:54,415 --> 00:45:58,875
- Okay, let's say I'm a big wave.
- Hold on. No, no, no, no.

714
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,885
- Hey, where you...
- Hold on!

715
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:03,745
- Where are you going?
- It's my board, man, all right?

716
00:46:03,925 --> 00:46:06,895
Why don't you take your board
and go try it out?

717
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,655
Maybe I will. Piece of junk. Watch!

718
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:17,125
Nice ride, man.
Nice ride.

719
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:20,335
This is supposed to be fun.

720
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:24,235
I got three days until the contest.
I don't have time for fun.

721
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,245
No time for fun, huh?

722
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:28,875
- Hey, Cody!
- What?

723
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:31,845
Bring me some clams
when you come back!

724
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:34,715
I'm not coming back!

725
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:37,355
- He'll be back.
- No, I won't!

726
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:39,115
He'll be back.

727
00:46:39,555 --> 00:46:41,685
- You guys like barbecue?
- Yeah, sure.

728
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,415
Got some wood here.

729
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:47,695
I wasted my whole day and I have
nothing to show for it, which is...

730
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:56,635
- I was just going to check on you...
- That's why you were...

731
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:58,105
...and the Geek.

732
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:01,575
- Listen. The Geek is Big Z.
- What?

733
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:02,975
- I know.
- You know?

734
00:47:03,145 --> 00:47:05,085
- How did you find out?
- We went to the beach.

735
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,475
- You got him to the beach?
- Yeah.

736
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:09,275
I've been trying to get Z
out of that tree for 10 years...

737
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:11,825
...and you got him all the way
down to the beach in one day?

738
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,515
This is fantastic!

739
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:20,925
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

740
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:25,965
Do you want to go somewhere
really, really fun?

741
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,765
Unless you want...
Did you want to get back to Big Z?

742
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:31,305
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have invited you.
- No, no, no.

743
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,415
- What? Okay. No?
- No, look. I want to have fun.

744
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:36,845
- Okay.
- Do I need mints or something?

745
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:39,985
- You tell me.
- No, you won't need mints.

746
00:47:40,715 --> 00:47:44,515
Z used to carry us up here on his
shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

747
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:47,315
- It's one of my favorite spots.
- Really?

748
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:50,425
- Boy, to be 8 years old again.
- What is this?

749
00:47:50,595 --> 00:47:52,585
You don't want to
get all cut up, do you?

750
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:54,095
Hold on. What are you doing?

751
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:56,525
No, no, no. I'm out of here.
I'm better off...

752
00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:10,035
It's going down! No, no, no!

753
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:18,415
- This is insane!
- Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

754
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,155
All right!

755
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:29,265
Now I'm in front of you.
What's going on now?

756
00:48:29,435 --> 00:48:30,925
It's not a race!

757
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,615
Okay, wait, don't take the left...
Cody!

758
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:51,315
- Give up, slowpoke! It's over with now!
- Not for long!

759
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:53,855
Give up now, sucker!

760
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:01,365
- I beat you!
- Congratulations, you sure did.

761
00:49:01,535 --> 00:49:03,095
You should probably
get out of there.

762
00:49:03,265 --> 00:49:05,535
Why is that? This stuff is...
Look at me. It's so beautiful.

763
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:07,295
Look at it. What is this stuff?

764
00:49:07,475 --> 00:49:10,305
See those things up above you?
They're glowworms.

765
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:14,935
So you're right beneath them.
Yeah, that's poop.

766
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,725
You know how some stinks stink
and other stinks smell good?

767
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:31,155
- Yeah.
- This is, like, a good stink.

768
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:32,315
A good stink?

769
00:49:32,995 --> 00:49:34,725
Can I tell you something personal?

770
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:37,165
We're in the shower together.
You can say whatever you want.

771
00:49:37,335 --> 00:49:41,775
I'm serious. I'm really, really
jealous of you.

772
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,065
Why?

773
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:47,105
I couldn't get Z off his butt
for the last 10 years...

774
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,805
...and then you come along and...

775
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:52,745
He must really think a lot of you.

776
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:56,475
I don't know. I've been a jerk to him.
I don't know what he thinks.

777
00:49:56,655 --> 00:49:58,745
- You haven't.
- I have. I've been a jerk.

778
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,495
- I have.
- Then go not be a jerk.

779
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:05,925
What does it matter to you anyways?

780
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,795
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

781
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:19,445
Okay.

782
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,605
Z? No.

783
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:28,545
No, no, no, don't you do it.
Z, don't do it. No.

784
00:51:28,715 --> 00:51:30,575
- No.
- Let's see here.

785
00:51:30,745 --> 00:51:32,615
- I swear...
- It's stronger than I thought.

786
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:36,115
...if you break it...
- Should've been broken by now.

787
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:38,945
Come on! Come on!

788
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,385
Look at that.

789
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:49,625
That's the best place
in the world to be, in the tube.

790
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:50,825
Really?

791
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:55,405
Yeah. Better than winning,
the trophy, all that stuff.

792
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:59,605
Tube riding
is the ultimate thing in surfing...

793
00:51:59,775 --> 00:52:01,975
...to ride inside the wave
and make it out of it.

794
00:52:02,145 --> 00:52:03,735
It's all we want to do every day.

795
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:06,855
It's almost impossible to describe.

796
00:52:07,015 --> 00:52:08,955
There's nothing I can compare it to.

797
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:13,585
It's a feeling that not too many people
will experience...

798
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:15,755
...so it's special in that sense.

799
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:17,295
Then you try to remember it.

800
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:20,395
Like, "I wish I could remember that,"
or "I wish I could get that again."

801
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:22,225
It's so addicting.

802
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:26,435
Once you get inside
you never want to get out.

803
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:32,095
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

804
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:37,775
So, that aside, how many points
would you get for getting tubed?

805
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:40,285
Like, what does it depend on
for the contest?

806
00:52:40,455 --> 00:52:42,685
- Points?
- What?

807
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:45,375
You know who you
sound like right now?

808
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:47,315
I promote happiness!

809
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:51,125
Can you see the happiness emanating
from me? What's wrong with you?

810
00:52:51,295 --> 00:52:53,125
- We're live.
- Good. Good.

811
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:57,595
I have to say, I have no doubt
that this year's Big Z Memorial...

812
00:52:57,765 --> 00:52:59,105
...is gonna be the best ever.

813
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:02,995
With the competition
just one day away...

814
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:07,665
...the excitement is definitely building
here on Pen Gu Island.

815
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:31,395
That didn't take too long.
I feel lightheaded.

816
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:32,795
So get this.

817
00:53:33,135 --> 00:53:37,195
On my search for Cody,
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.

818
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:40,735
I get it. You guys look hungry.

819
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:44,145
You've probably got
the munchies or something.

820
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:48,485
Squidito on el stickito?

821
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:02,165
Check it out! Dude,
have you seen my friend Cody?

822
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:05,065
He's kind of like a penguin.

823
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:08,335
He's got a lot of black on him,
a lot of white.

824
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:11,995
- How did you learn how to surf?
- I saw Big Z do it, actually.

825
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:14,075
I don't think you were born yet.

826
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:16,645
- I wasn't?
- No, I don't think so.

827
00:54:16,915 --> 00:54:21,685
Lani? I like her when
she teaches us because...

828
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:23,585
Smudge! Not another one!

829
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:26,275
I think he really has to go
to the bathroom right now.

830
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,655
What's next? The board is done.

831
00:54:28,825 --> 00:54:30,725
- The board is done?
- The board is done.

832
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:34,795
- Well, let's do some training.
- Finally!

833
00:54:35,135 --> 00:54:38,225
- Can we get a shot of you...
- You've got to get it in a long shot.

834
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,765
Hey, Z! Come on!

835
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:43,875
- Where you going?
- I thought we were going to train.

836
00:54:44,045 --> 00:54:47,495
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

837
00:54:48,915 --> 00:54:52,045
- You want to surf like Big Z used to?
- Yeah.

838
00:54:52,215 --> 00:54:54,915
I've got some tests here
to figure out your potential.

839
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:57,615
- Let's do it.
- No, put them on your eyes.

840
00:54:57,785 --> 00:55:00,275
- Like this.
- On my eyes.

841
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:06,025
- Take it, Cody.
- Can we do some training, seriously?

842
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:08,325
What are you talking about?
What do you think we're doing?

843
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:10,525
Acting like nutjobs.
That's what I think we're doing.

844
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:13,105
Yeah, good. You're learning!

845
00:55:13,275 --> 00:55:15,295
And a big set comes in.

846
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:19,375
Wipeout!

847
00:55:19,715 --> 00:55:21,615
- That's it!
- Take it easy!

848
00:55:22,075 --> 00:55:23,675
This is getting ridiculous.

849
00:55:23,845 --> 00:55:25,285
- You having fun?
- I hate you.

850
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:27,815
Big, you know, slow:

851
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:32,815
He does this flip over the top.
All right, now you go.

852
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:37,825
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

853
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:43,465
I'm starting to see it, man. I think
I know what you're talking about.

854
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:47,465
That's great. As long as
we're all having fun, right?

855
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:51,935
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

856
00:56:00,555 --> 00:56:02,515
Hey, Z, breakfast!

857
00:56:04,525 --> 00:56:05,885
Not a chance.

858
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:09,815
- Four, three, two...
- You gotta get up early in the morning...

859
00:56:10,395 --> 00:56:11,485
...one.

860
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:21,425
That is fun.

861
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:24,545
- You're having fun?
- I am. Yes. Now I am.

862
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:26,305
Then, Cody...

863
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:28,135
...you passed!
- What?

864
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,805
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

865
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:35,515
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing?
Yes! Yes!

866
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,665
Hey, check it...

867
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:56,495
I didn't know you could surf!

868
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:03,975
Relax!

869
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:07,845
Long, slow, smooth.

870
00:57:08,015 --> 00:57:09,855
- Like making the board!
- There you go.

871
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:12,955
- All right. Okay.
- Feels good, yeah?

872
00:57:24,165 --> 00:57:29,035
- You're in the water, Z!
- Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

873
00:57:33,515 --> 00:57:37,205
Lani, thank you.

874
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,885
Look at that!

875
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:01,665
- Nice! That's it! Nice.
- Great ride!

876
00:58:27,035 --> 00:58:28,825
Big Z is back!

877
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,615
This is what it's all about.

878
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:45,935
What could be better than this?

879
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,405
I need some help
on this landing for the high note

880
00:59:19,915 --> 00:59:22,715
Nice. Nice.

881
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:25,185
- Is that the only song that you know?
- Pretty much.

882
00:59:25,355 --> 00:59:27,825
You want to hear it again?
It goes like this.

883
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,725
No? Okay. I got you there, didn't I?

884
00:59:30,895 --> 00:59:34,555
I must say you were
quite amazing out there today.

885
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:37,495
- You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
- Thanks to this guy.

886
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:42,895
- I just pointed you in a direction.
- Question, Z.

887
00:59:44,075 --> 00:59:46,095
- Change your mind about the song?
- No, no, no.

888
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:47,745
Here, it goes something like this...

889
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:50,645
I was wondering if you could come
watch me ride tomorrow.

890
00:59:52,245 --> 00:59:54,645
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

891
00:59:54,815 --> 00:59:59,485
- No, not just... In the contest.
- Contest? What contest?

892
00:59:59,655 --> 01:00:01,855
The Big Z Memorial.
Remember that one?

893
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:03,655
I know I'm asking a lot...

894
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:06,225
...but it would really, really be...

895
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,525
...the biggest thing in the world
to me if you could come.

896
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:14,435
- You still want to be a part of that?
- Absolutely.

897
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:19,465
- Why do you want me there anyway?
- I thought you'd want to be there.

898
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:22,615
- I don't know why it's a big deal.
- It's no big deal.

899
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:24,715
Why won't you come?

900
01:00:24,945 --> 01:00:26,215
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

901
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:28,185
- Give it a rest.
- It's getting cold, guys.

902
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:29,915
- Tell me why you're hiding.
- Hiding?

903
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,455
- Why are you hiding?
- I'll have to eat all this by myself.

904
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:34,755
Why didn't you come back
after you fell off the wave?

905
01:00:35,825 --> 01:00:37,955
That wave.

906
01:00:39,795 --> 01:00:44,925
That last day, winning had
become everything to me.

907
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:46,895
I knew I was gonna beat Tank.

908
01:00:48,205 --> 01:00:54,375
But then, you know,
he starts to surf circles around me.

909
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:57,605
I saw what he was doing.
I couldn't do what he was doing.

910
01:00:58,415 --> 01:01:00,715
Times had changed.

911
01:01:01,815 --> 01:01:04,655
I didn't want to walk back
on that beach with all my fans there.

912
01:01:04,825 --> 01:01:09,285
A loser. Everyone looking
at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.

913
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:11,525
So...

914
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:22,675
Big Z's dead,
and that's how it's gonna stay.

915
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,465
Let me play you that song.

916
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:29,645
What about "never give up"?
What about "find a way"?

917
01:01:29,985 --> 01:01:34,915
- You're giving up. You're giving up!
- Yeah, I'm giving up. That's my way.

918
01:01:35,385 --> 01:01:38,655
- Giving up.
- I thought you were the one guy.

919
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:41,795
You don't like it, find your own way.

920
01:01:43,565 --> 01:01:45,085
Leave me out of it.

921
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:47,485
Leave me out of it.

922
01:02:15,055 --> 01:02:17,555
I messed up.
I'm just...

923
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:19,755
I'm... not good.

924
01:02:20,165 --> 01:02:22,895
This is when I needed someone.
I needed him.

925
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:26,835
It's hard enough
losing one dad, but...

926
01:02:27,905 --> 01:02:30,335
- What do you mean by...?
- Nothing.

927
01:02:30,545 --> 01:02:32,835
Nothing, man. Forget it.

928
01:02:47,425 --> 01:02:49,725
Peaceful. Peaceful.
I'm in peace. I come in peace.

929
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:51,085
- Cody!
- Joe!

930
01:02:51,495 --> 01:02:54,795
- I've been looking everywhere for you!
- You've been looking for me?

931
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:57,795
I didn't lose you on the whale.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

932
01:02:57,965 --> 01:03:01,405
- Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
- Radical.

933
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:06,105
They're starting!
Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

934
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,775
Wait a minute. Joe?

935
01:03:07,945 --> 01:03:09,035
Surfers riding...

936
01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:12,235
I'm sorry. Watch this, dude.
I can speak their language.

937
01:03:16,155 --> 01:03:19,355
I totally need my board. I don't
know where it is. I gotta go find it.

938
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:21,715
- I'll see you in the lineup.
- See you, Joe.

939
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:24,415
- This is gonna be fun, huh?
- See you.

940
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,725
The tenth annual Big Z
is about to get underway...

941
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:32,695
...and, whoa, it is the day of days.

942
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:36,065
Big mountainous bombs
marching into our coastline.

943
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:40,005
Kelly Slater, on a danger level,
one to ten, give me a number.

944
01:03:40,175 --> 01:03:41,165
Twenty.

945
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:43,375
- Wow. Rob?
- There'll be blood.

946
01:03:43,545 --> 01:03:45,485
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

947
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,615
- What are you doing here?
- Mike.

948
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:51,055
You're gonna kill yourself.
Don't do this to yourself.

949
01:03:51,225 --> 01:03:52,555
Look what happened last time.

950
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:55,525
- It's good to see you back.
- Are you serious?

951
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:57,215
You're gonna be
a real crowd pleaser.

952
01:03:57,395 --> 01:03:59,725
I'm telling you,
these people are gonna eat you up.

953
01:03:59,895 --> 01:04:03,385
- I'll be expecting big things from you.
- Thank you.

954
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:05,795
People, big announcement.
Cody Maverick, he's back.

955
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:07,305
The Wipeout King is back...

956
01:04:07,475 --> 01:04:09,565
...and I'm gonna tell you,
start looking for the sharks.

957
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,795
They'll be circling because
there's gonna be blood.

958
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:13,405
Spectacular carnage today.

959
01:04:13,575 --> 01:04:17,515
Thank you! Reggie Belafonte. Little
guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart.

960
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,345
Look at this.
You're going down, snowflake.

961
01:04:31,525 --> 01:04:34,755
I'm gonna make you wish
you were never even hatched.

962
01:04:35,895 --> 01:04:38,425
You want to see my trophies?

963
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:49,875
Arnold, no.

964
01:04:55,885 --> 01:04:58,875
About 24 surfers
battling their way out to the...

965
01:04:59,925 --> 01:05:02,725
Good golly! Make that 18.

966
01:05:05,995 --> 01:05:08,395
Rob, after such a heavy wipeout
earlier in the week...

967
01:05:08,565 --> 01:05:10,595
...what do you think is going
through Maverick's mind?

968
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:14,765
He's gonna have to stay focused and
channel that energy into good places.

969
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:16,735
When are you gonna get a life?

970
01:05:19,145 --> 01:05:20,905
You are a nobody.

971
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,405
You should've stayed
in Antarctica, kid.

972
01:05:48,975 --> 01:05:51,835
He made it! Yeah, good.

973
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:55,875
What an amazing first ride
mind-blower from Maverick.

974
01:06:01,585 --> 01:06:03,245
Did you guys see that?

975
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:06,515
Man. I thought I was gonna lose it,
and then I just...

976
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,655
I just let go, you know.
I let go, and there it was.

977
01:06:11,925 --> 01:06:14,595
Wow, it's been an amazing day...

978
01:06:14,765 --> 01:06:16,755
...of shredding in less than
stellar conditions...

979
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:19,865
...but I never would have guessed
our three finalists.

980
01:06:20,035 --> 01:06:22,165
Well, Sal, it's no surprise
that Tank Evans...

981
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,435
...has just breezed his way
into the finals.

982
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:29,905
And Cody Maverick, from a horrible
wipeout a few days ago to this.

983
01:06:32,285 --> 01:06:35,515
And Chicken Joe from Sheboygan.
Who would have guessed it?

984
01:06:36,155 --> 01:06:39,455
I have never seen a finals like this.

985
01:06:40,595 --> 01:06:43,215
- We're in the finals, Joe.
- No way! We get to surf some more?

986
01:06:43,395 --> 01:06:46,725
Isn't it exciting?
Look at that. This is great, huh?

987
01:06:46,995 --> 01:06:50,335
You know, you should know this.
The Tank loves you.

988
01:06:51,235 --> 01:06:53,665
Looks like this will be
the easiest year ever.

989
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:57,765
No way. Cody, did you hear that?
It's gonna be easy.

990
01:06:58,505 --> 01:07:01,175
Are you loving this?

991
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:05,515
So who would you like
to see win the trophy?

992
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:08,275
It's not so important to me.

993
01:07:08,455 --> 01:07:11,115
Friends are better than anything
in the world.

994
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:12,485
Friends are forever.

995
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,425
Trophies, you never know
what they can have happen to them.

996
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:20,525
- That was awesome, mate.
- Muy impresivo, my friend.

997
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:22,025
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

998
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,195
- Finals.
- Hey!

999
01:07:24,365 --> 01:07:27,035
Yeah. I know. I can't even...

1000
01:07:27,975 --> 01:07:30,635
I think I can win this thing.
It's too much right now.

1001
01:07:30,805 --> 01:07:33,295
- Well, that's all you came for.
- What?

1002
01:07:33,475 --> 01:07:36,575
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You made it pretty clear last night...

1003
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:38,805
...that winning's more important
to you than Z or me.

1004
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:41,385
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take
your stupid trophy home.

1005
01:07:41,555 --> 01:07:43,955
- Lani. Come on.
- Come here, you!

1006
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:45,755
How about this, huh?

1007
01:07:45,925 --> 01:07:50,985
Let me tell you something. You win
this thing, we're going places!

1008
01:07:51,195 --> 01:07:54,095
Look at this kid.
He is a champ!

1009
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:07,835
Tank, nine-time defending champion.
He will roll on you.

1010
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:11,505
Expect him to win this thing. It's
basically a contest for second place.

1011
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:16,345
First, I'm gonna take you down.
Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.

1012
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:21,425
That cloud looks just like a kitten.

1013
01:08:34,935 --> 01:08:36,735
Maverick and Evans take off.

1014
01:08:37,445 --> 01:08:38,465
Mine!

1015
01:08:38,645 --> 01:08:40,975
And it's Evans dropping in.

1016
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:46,735
And Tank's playing games,
blocking Maverick's every move.

1017
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:49,205
Maverick sticks a rail.

1018
01:08:50,425 --> 01:08:55,115
Tank Evans down!
I have never, ever seen this before!

1019
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:58,585
But I'd love to see it again.

1020
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:02,395
Cody trying to take back the wave
that Tank snaked from him.

1021
01:09:02,565 --> 01:09:04,865
Evans toying with him,
not paying attention.

1022
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:07,265
And there's the outside rail.
Evans goes down.

1023
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:11,965
And it's Maverick with this new-school
move. We'll call it "The Maverick."

1024
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:20,945
And look at this.
Maverick scoring big.

1025
01:09:22,015 --> 01:09:26,455
Oh, it's so cute.
It's got little paws and the whiskers.

1026
01:09:29,425 --> 01:09:32,255
Chicken Joe
with a no-paddle drop-in!

1027
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,765
- Here we go!
- Nobody needs to help this chicken.

1028
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:39,025
I'm flying!

1029
01:09:40,605 --> 01:09:45,705
Maverick and Joe tied, and no score
for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.

1030
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:51,175
Surfers, this is your final wave!

1031
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:55,685
- Joe, this is it. This wave wins it.
- Yeah, man!

1032
01:09:57,685 --> 01:10:02,025
This wave is stacking up
to be a beautiful tube.

1033
01:10:02,655 --> 01:10:05,895
Maverick should score big
on this one!

1034
01:10:07,735 --> 01:10:10,065
But wait! Evans drops in.

1035
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:13,825
It looks like Evans
is gonna take out the chicken.

1036
01:10:19,245 --> 01:10:20,575
What's Maverick doing?

1037
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:23,645
- Go, Joe, go!
- Got it! Let's go!

1038
01:10:23,815 --> 01:10:26,715
I don't believe this.
This contest was Maverick's to win.

1039
01:10:26,915 --> 01:10:30,645
Now Evans pushing Maverick out
of bounds and into The Boneyards.

1040
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:46,195
- Tank, look out!
- You look out!

1041
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:22,565
Code!

1042
01:11:25,105 --> 01:11:26,095
Z!

1043
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,145
- Cody, come on.
- Z!

1044
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:36,085
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster!
Come on. Dig!

1045
01:11:37,325 --> 01:11:39,725
Don't dig! Don't dig!

1046
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:40,985
What?

1047
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:44,185
Let the wave carry you!

1048
01:11:44,825 --> 01:11:46,485
You're gonna have to time it!

1049
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:50,155
You're gonna come right here,
right to me!

1050
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:55,695
Five... four...

1051
01:11:55,935 --> 01:11:58,535
Three... two... one.

1052
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,085
Z!

1053
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:21,925
Where's Cody?

1054
01:12:26,305 --> 01:12:28,365
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

1055
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:31,635
This is a reminder
of the young surfer...

1056
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:36,875
...who gave his life
for the sport he loved.

1057
01:12:41,085 --> 01:12:42,885
There you are.

1058
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:50,955
I can't believe it! I can't believe it.

1059
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:53,495
You came back.

1060
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,655
You saved my life, man.
Thank you.

1061
01:12:56,835 --> 01:13:00,205
Hey, hey, come on.
You're gonna tip us!

1062
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:04,665
Well, I lost.

1063
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:08,035
Me too.

1064
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:13,175
Come on. Let's go, loser.

1065
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,385
You want to help me out here?

1066
01:13:15,555 --> 01:13:20,685
You know the routine. Come on. Long.
That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

1067
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:26,015
Young Joey MacEnroe
was a beacon for a new generation.

1068
01:13:26,195 --> 01:13:29,165
May he rest in peace.

1069
01:13:31,065 --> 01:13:34,125
So, what am I bid for the board?
Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

1070
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:36,465
- Don't touch his stuff, man.
- Pal, if you want to bid...

1071
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,835
- Give me that.
- Hey...!

1072
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:46,315
Hey. Hey, everyone.

1073
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:49,615
- How you been?
- Oh, my gosh!

1074
01:13:49,815 --> 01:13:51,985
- Yeah...
- Hey, man, that's Z.

1075
01:13:52,185 --> 01:13:53,745
...that's me.

1076
01:13:53,925 --> 01:13:56,155
Skank, what's happening, man?

1077
01:13:56,325 --> 01:13:58,985
Got a little sand
in your egg sac there, fella.

1078
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:01,495
- Where have you been, Z?
- What happened?

1079
01:14:02,365 --> 01:14:03,695
Oh, you know...

1080
01:14:05,665 --> 01:14:10,665
...I got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1081
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:14,705
...he pointed the way back.

1082
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:27,755
Could you please shut that off?
Could you give me a minute?

1083
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:36,065
Check it out! How about this?

1084
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:38,705
You want to talk about talent scout?
People find talent.

1085
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:44,565
I bring them back from the dead.
The now living legend, ladies and...

1086
01:14:44,745 --> 01:14:46,075
- Shut up.
- What? Shut up?

1087
01:14:46,245 --> 01:14:50,235
I'm not a legend. I'm a guy looking for
some nice waves, some good friends.

1088
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:54,375
Hey, guys, the swell is happening
over on the north shore!

1089
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:55,915
I'm right behind you, Z.

1090
01:14:56,085 --> 01:14:57,415
Ouch, that hurt.

1091
01:14:59,555 --> 01:15:03,825
Come back here!
You don't just walk away! Come on!

1092
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:06,565
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

1093
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,695
Tank, how does it feel
to lose after nine time...

1094
01:15:11,335 --> 01:15:14,565
I wasn't kissing her.
You can't have her!

1095
01:15:18,105 --> 01:15:19,095
Can we get a few words?

1096
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:21,935
You gave up the trophy to help Joe.
What's that about?

1097
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:25,015
You know, Rob,
that's what friends do.

1098
01:15:25,185 --> 01:15:28,305
- How's it feel to win, Joe?
- I won?

1099
01:15:28,485 --> 01:15:31,785
Come on! I'll tell my mom.
Gimme. Gimme!

1100
01:15:33,455 --> 01:15:36,325
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

1101
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:40,085
Don't you walk away from me!
I am Reggie Belafon...

1102
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:45,125
Turn that thing off.
Mikey! You are so fired!

1103
01:15:45,735 --> 01:15:48,365
I can't imagine a better day.

1104
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:58,535
Dude, this... This whole
experience has just been...

1105
01:15:58,745 --> 01:16:01,645
It's amazing. Z?

1106
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:06,725
I don't think I've ever had
a better friend to me in my life.

1107
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,555
It's just really cool
to have everything I need.

1108
01:16:11,425 --> 01:16:13,895
- Don't do it. Help!
- Arnold!

1109
01:16:14,065 --> 01:16:17,465
To be honest, man, I'm kind of, like,
bored of talking about myself.

1110
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:21,295
So, is that cool?
You guys got what you need?

1111
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:23,765
- We got it.
- All right. Be good!

1112
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:33,905
Cowabunga!

1113
01:17:41,955 --> 01:17:43,885
Of course we're proud of him!

1114
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:45,885
What mother wouldn't be
proud of him?

1115
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:48,315
We're so full of proudness.

1116
01:17:48,495 --> 01:17:50,395
You know what?
He followed his dream...

1117
01:17:50,565 --> 01:17:54,325
...and he went out there, and now
he's coming home with the trophy.

1118
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:56,485
I can't wait to see his trophy.

1119
01:17:56,665 --> 01:17:58,655
There's not really a trophy.

1120
01:17:59,405 --> 01:18:01,835
Is there, like, a big shell
or something like that?

1121
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:04,735
There's no shell. There's no trophy.
Well, he didn't win.

1122
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:05,935
What?

1123
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:09,305
How bad was it?
Did he get smoked?

1124
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:12,675
- He was in the finals.
- Second place? That's losing.

1125
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:15,185
- Winning is not everything, Glen.
- Right.

1126
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:16,845
Look at what Cody did...

1127
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,185
Go back to the
"winning isn't everything" thing.

1128
01:18:19,425 --> 01:18:21,685
That doesn't compute, really.

1129
01:18:21,855 --> 01:18:27,355
You know what, Glen? I really hope
someday you can be more like Cody.

1130
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:29,295
This interview is over.

1131
01:25:00,455 --> 01:25:02,855
Remember when were talking
about you leaving? That was great.

1132
01:25:03,025 --> 01:25:04,655
Remember when
you were gonna go?

1133
01:25:04,825 --> 01:25:06,855
- We were gonna go...
- You should still go.

1134
01:25:07,095 --> 01:25:08,155
It's technical equipment.

1135
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:12,325
I know what I'm doing. I can unplug
one of your little Hollywood devices.

1136
01:25:12,835 --> 01:25:15,135
The lighting thing,
whatever you call that...

1137
01:25:15,305 --> 01:25:17,165
...and then the microphone thing.

1138
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:18,675
Go back to Hollywood.

1139
01:25:18,845 --> 01:25:20,335
Cody would never do this.
